1.Parse and Preprocess Data
- Correct parsing and storing (2/2)
- Addressed NaN entries (1/1)

2.Impute or delete missing entries
- Impute NaN with median of feature (1/1)
- Median is addressed for even and odd list size (1/1)
- Explanation for median (1/1)
- Discard NaN entries (1/1)

3.Working with the data
- Shuffling the data (2/2)
- Std of each feature (1/1)
- Remove entries containing value more than 2 std from mean (2/2)
- Standardize data points (2/2)
- Time and Complexity of standardization (0.5/1) - Runtime complexity is O(nm) where n is the num of data and m num of features. Also there is no explanation why it is O(n^2)

4. Working with non-numerical data
- Gender manipulation (1/1)
- Embarked feature manipulation (2/2)

5. Train-test split
- Shuffle data (1/1)
- Split dataset (3/3)
- Create cross-validation set (3/3)

4.Good quality code and documentation - It is easier to add all scripts into one and show how you call the functions for the input datasets.
